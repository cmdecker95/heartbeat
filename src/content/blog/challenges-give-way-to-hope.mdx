If you attended one of our 2020 Vision Banquets, you heard her story. For those who didn’t, we’d like to you meet a very special woman who came to our pregnancy center lost and in despair. She was already dealing with multiple personal challenges, and on top of those, was facing an unplanned pregnancy. She speaks openly about getting help, about the people in her life who have made a difference, about the love and care she received from the pregnancy center staff, and about answered prayers. In the midst of dark depression and mixed emotions about her future, she found **hope** in a new life and the new addition to her family. Watch the video to experience her touching story of love and possibility.
